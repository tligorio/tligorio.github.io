This course introduces students to the rapidly evolving principles, architectures, and methodologies underlying the design and engineering of AI Agents.
Students will explore how modern large language models (LLMs) enable intelligent, tool-using systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously.
The course blends theory with hands-on practice, providing an opportunity to engage critically and creatively with emerging technologies. Students will apply foundational computer science concepts while developing agentic systems. Emphasis will be placed on responsible design, collaboration, and the societal impact of AI.
